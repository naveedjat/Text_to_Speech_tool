# 🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS) Web Application

A simple and interactive **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** web app built with **Streamlit**, **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**, and **Tempfile** in Python.  
This app allows users to input text, convert it into natural-sounding speech, and play or download the generated audio directly in the browser.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Convert any text into speech instantly  
- Simple and elegant Streamlit UI  
- Real-time audio playback  
- Efficient temporary file handling (no need to store files permanently)  
- Powered by **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters text in the input area.  
2. The app processes the text using the **gTTS** library.  
3. The generated audio is saved temporarily using Python’s **Tempfile** module.  
4. The speech is played in real-time via Streamlit’s built-in audio player.

    if text.strip():
        # Convert text to speech
        tts = gTTS(text)
        
        # Create temporary file to store audio
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True) as temp_audio:
